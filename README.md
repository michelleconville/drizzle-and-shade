# Planning

## Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering features in sprints. There were 4 sprints in total, the work was carried out over four weeks.

Initially user stories were developed, and a full set of acceptance criteria was created in order to define the functionality of the required feature. These user stories were assigned to epics (milestones) and prioritised under the labels, Must have, Should have, and Could have. Then they were assigned to sprints and story pointed, according to complexity. Must have user stories were completed first, followed by should haves and then finally could haves. This approach was taken to ensure that all core requirements were completed first, with the nice to have features being added should there be capacity.

In GitHub projects, a Kanban board was used to track the progress of the project, the workflow started with To do then In Progress, Done and finally Closed.
